Example1: Allow everyone read-only access to a bucket
In this example, everyone, including anonymous, is allowed to list objects in the bucket and
perform Get Object operations on all objects in the bucket. All other operations will be denied.
Note that this policy might not be particularly useful since no one except the account root has
permissions to write to the bucket.

    }
  ]
}

Example2: Allow everyone in one account full access, and everyone in another
account read-only access to a bucket
In this example, everyone in one specified account is allowed full access to a bucket, while
everyone in another specified account is only permitted to List the bucket and perform
GetObject operations on objects in the bucket beginning with the shared/ object key prefix.
Note: In StorageGRID, objects created by a non-owner account (including anonymous
accounts) are owned by the bucket owner account. The bucket policy applies to these
objects.

Example3: Allows the specified user to create objects in the Bucket,
but not to delete them
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {

Example4: Allow everyone read-only access to a bucket and full access by
specified group or user
In this example, everyone including anonymous, is allowed to List the bucket and perform
GET Object operations on all objects in the bucket, while only users belonging the group
Marketing in the specified account are allowed full access.

      ]
    }
  ]
}

Example5: Allow everyone read and write access to a bucket if client in IP range
In this example, everyone, including anonymous, is allowed to List the bucket and perform any
Object operations on all objects in the bucket, provided that the requests come from a specified
IP range (54.240.143.0 to 54.240.143.255, except 54.240.143.188). All other operations will be
denied, and all requests outside of the IP range will be denied.

  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowEveryoneReadWriteAccessIfInSourceIpRange",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",

        "NotIpAddress": {"aws:SourceIp": "54.240.143.188"}
      }
    }
  ]
}

Example6: Allow full access to a bucket exclusively by a specified federated user
In this example, the federated user Bob is allowed full access to the examplebucket bucket
and its objects. All other users, including ‘root’, are explicitly denied all operations. Note
however that ‘root’ is never denied permissions to Put/Get/DeleteBucketPolicy.
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "SGWS": "urn:sgws:identity::87854959936252872848:federated-user/Bob"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:sgws:s3:::examplebucket",
        "arn:sgws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "NotPrincipal": {
        "SGWS": "urn:sgws:identity::87854959936252872848:federated-user/Bob"

        "arn:sgws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Example7: PutOverwriteObject permission
In this example, the Deny Effect for PutOverwriteObject and DeleteObject ensures that no one
can overwrite or delete the object’s data, user-defined metadata, and S3 object tagging.
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutOverwriteObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:DeleteObjectVersion"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:sgws:s3:::wormbucket/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "SGWS": "urn:sgws:identity::87854959936252872848:federated-group/SomeGroup"
      },
