# Examples of pktt start:
1. pktt start e0
This will start capturing network traffic from the "e0" interface. All traffic will be logged to a 128K circular buffer. Or, if tracing
had been suspended previously it would be restarted.
2. pktt start fa3 -d / -s 100m -b 2m
This starts capturing traffic on the "fa3" interface, writing to a file called "/fa3.trc" which will be allowed to grow to a
maximum size of 100MB, with a 2MB buffer.
3. pktt start el10 -d /home -m 10k -b 500k -i ehost1 -i ehost2
This starts capturing traffic to and from the hosts "ehost1" and "ehost2", storing the traces into the file "/home/el10.trc". Up to
10K of each of the packets will be stored, in a 500K buffer. Note that this will only work if the hostnames can be resolved.
pktt start all -b 128k -i 172.20.4.1
All interfaces will start capturing traffic to and from the specified IP address. This is a quick way to look at traffic if you're not
sure which interface to use but you want to see the packets from one or more IP addresses.
4. pktt start ns0 -i 3FFE:81D0:107:2082::1
After enabling IPv6 option, executing the pktt start command with IPv6 address as the filter will capture all packets that are
coming from or to the IPv6 address. The trace file dumped after executing pktt dump command should display only the
packets having the IPv6 address as the source or destination.
